        <p>the saint shepherds her flock, innocent souls.<br>
            only there they reach towards a unity.</p>
            
        <p>the empty castle grows larger with every new member.<br>
            she keeps it working, halls are warmer ever since.<br>
            seasons pass.<br>
            nothing survives change besides her.<br>
            always a constant.<br>
            the key is in her eyes.<br></p>
