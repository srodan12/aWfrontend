        <p>I don't have much time now. everyday those days are fading away more and more.
            I couldn't remember Anette's name today. We used to bring her to that little park besides that goddamn place.
            I never should have met that man. Not if all this progress did was to make me slowly forget everything.
            What if he really is from 2024? How could he know that i would forget? Is DataLink really what he said? -JB
